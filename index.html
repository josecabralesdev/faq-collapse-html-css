          <p>A credit card is a plastic card that allows you to borrow money from a financial institution to make
            purchases. You're given a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can borrow. You can then use the
            card
            to make purchases and pay back the borrowed amount later, usually with interest.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</strong>: The interest rate charged on your credit card balance. A
              lower APR is better.</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Fee</strong>: Some cards have annual fees. Choose a card with a low or no annual fee.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rewards Program</strong>: Consider what type of rewards program is most valuable to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Limit</strong>: Choose a card with a credit limit that suits your needs.</li>

          <h2>What is a credit score and how does it affect my credit card options?</h2>
          <img id="collapse-close" src="./assets/caret-down.svg" alt="collapse icon">
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A credit card score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness. A higher credit score generally
            means you have a good credit history and are more likely to approved for credit cards with better terms,
            such as lower APRs and higher credit limits.</p>
